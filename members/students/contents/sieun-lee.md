tags:
  - "Missingness"
  - "Time-Series Imputation"
  - "Diffusion Models"

about: I'm interested in missingness-aware time-series modeling (imputation, diffusion, downstream) across manufacturing and healthcare, as well as AI industry–academia projects and new model development.

interests:
  - Missingness analysis & indicators in sensor/clinical data
  - Time-series imputation (predictive, generative, diffusion)
  - Anomaly detection & reliability analytics in manufacturing & healthcare
  - Downstream task evaluation and integration
  - AI industry–academia collaboration & new model development
