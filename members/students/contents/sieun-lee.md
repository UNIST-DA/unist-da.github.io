about: I'm interested in missingness-aware time-series modeling (imputation, diffusion, downstream) across manufacturing and healthcare, as well as AI industry–academia projects and new model development.

interests:
  - Missingness analysis & indicators in sensor/clinical data
  - Time-series imputation (predictive, generative, diffusion)
  - Anomaly detection & reliability analytics in manufacturing & healthcare
  - Downstream task evaluation and integration
  - AI industry–academia collaboration & new model development

### Current Work
- Building **missingness-aware imputation pipelines** for FDC/metrology data (multiple imputation vs. diffusion-based baselines).
- Developing **domain-free time-series drift monitoring** for long-horizon deployments.
- Researching **reliability & anomaly analytics** in semiconductor processes.
- Prototyping **maritime fuel optimization** combining AIS, weather, and engine signals.

### Notes for Collaboration
1. Principled missingness modeling for **reliability/quality engineering**  
2. Scalable **imputation + downstream** evaluation frameworks  
3. Cross-domain drift management and maritime/logistics analytics.
