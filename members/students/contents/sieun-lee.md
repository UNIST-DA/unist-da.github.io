### Current Work
- Building **missingness-aware imputation pipelines** for FDC/metrology data (multiple imputation vs. diffusion-based baselines).
- Developing **domain-free time-series drift monitoring** for long-horizon deployments.
- Researching **reliability & anomaly analytics** in semiconductor processes.
- Prototyping **maritime fuel optimization** combining AIS, weather, and engine signals.

### Notes for Collaboration
1. Principled missingness modeling for **reliability/quality engineering**  
2. Scalable **imputation + downstream** evaluation frameworks  
3. Cross-domain drift management and maritime/logistics analytics.
