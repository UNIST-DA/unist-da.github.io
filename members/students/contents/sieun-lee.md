## Overview
I am a first-year M.S. student in the **Data Analytics Lab (UNIST IE)**.  
My research centers on **missingness patterns** in multivariate time series and **robust imputation** for downstream tasks (classification, anomaly detection). I work with **diffusion-based** and **sequence generative** models (e.g., Diffusion-TS, CSDI, SSSD) and study how missingness indicators and sampling schemes affect reliability analysis in **semiconductor manufacturing** and **maritime operations**.

## Current Work
- **Missingness-aware imputation pipeline** for FDC/metrology data (multiple imputation vs. MTSI, diffusion-based baselines, evaluation with downstream risk models).
- **Domain-free time-series drift** monitoring for long-horizon deployments (representation stability, indicator-driven alarms).
- **Reliability & anomaly analytics** in semiconductor processes (process-to-product risk modeling).
- **Maritime fuel optimization** prototypes combining AIS, weather, and engine signals.

## Selected Highlights
- üèÜ **Grand Prize**, *2022 Marine & Fisheries Big Data Analysis Contest* ‚Äî CO‚ÇÇ reduction & cost-aware routing via ML.
- üìö **Seminars**: *Diffusion-TS (ICLR 2024)*, *Missingness Patterns* (DA-Lab seminar, 2025).
- üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ **Mentoring**: Private math tutoring, guidance on ML/statistics foundations.
