## Overview
I am a first-year M.S. student in the **Data Analytics Lab (UNIST IE)**.  
My research centers on **missingness patterns** in multivariate time series and **robust imputation** for downstream tasks (classification, anomaly detection). I work with **diffusion-based** and **sequence generative** models (e.g., Diffusion-TS, CSDI, SSSD) and study how missingness indicators and sampling schemes affect reliability analysis in **semiconductor manufacturing** and **maritime operations**.

## Current Work
- **Missingness-aware imputation pipeline** for FDC/metrology data (multiple imputation vs. MTSI, diffusion-based baselines, evaluation with downstream risk models).
- **Domain-free time-series drift** monitoring for long-horizon deployments (representation stability, indicator-driven alarms).
- **Reliability & anomaly analytics** in semiconductor processes (process-to-product risk modeling).
- **Maritime fuel optimization** prototypes combining AIS, weather, and engine signals.

## Methods & Tooling
- Modeling: LSTM/TCN, Transformers, **CSDI / SSSD / Diffusion-TS**, KNN/MICE, matrix factorization
- Analytics: clustering & embedding evaluation (Silhouette etc.), drift detection, ablation on missingness indicators
- Stack: Python (pandas, PyTorch), Jupyter, GitHub Pages/Jekyll for lab website

## Selected Highlights
- 🏆 **Grand Prize**, *2022 Marine & Fisheries Big Data Analysis Contest* — CO₂ reduction & cost-aware routing via ML.
- 📚 **Seminars**: *Diffusion-TS: Interpretable Diffusion for General Time Series Generation* (ICLR 2024, lab reading); *Missingness Patterns* (DA-Lab seminar, 2025).
- 👩🏻‍🏫 **Mentoring**: Private math tutoring (high-school), study guidance on model understanding & statistics.

## Notes for Collaboration
I'm interested in (1) principled missingness modeling for **reliability/quality engineering**, (2) scalable **imputation+downstream** evaluation suites, and (3) cross-domain drift frameworks. Happy to collaborate on semiconductor reliability, healthcare TS, and maritime/logistics data.
