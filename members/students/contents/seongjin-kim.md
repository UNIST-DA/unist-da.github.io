about: I'm a master's student in Industrial Engineering at UNIST, focusing on anomaly detection, and domain-specific RAG applications in real problems.

interests:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with domain knowledge and prompt engineering
  - Industry-academia collaboration in manufacturing, maritime, and finance
  - Robust anomaly detection for multivariate time-series under imbalance and noise
