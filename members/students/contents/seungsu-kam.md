about: I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at UNIST under the supervision of Professor Sungil Kim. My work involves Neural Differential Equations, Conditional Density Estimation, and Survival Analysis, which I apply to problems such as real-time anomaly detection, astronomical object anomaly detection, longitudinal patient outcome prediction, and personalized thyroid hormone dosage recommendation.

interests:
  - Irregularly sampled time series analysis
  - Time series anomaly detection & reliability analytics in manufacturing & healthcare
  - Multi-risk longitudinal survival analysis in healthcare
  - Irregular astronomical time series anomaly detection
